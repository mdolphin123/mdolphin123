## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jocelyn

I'm a student at Duke studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I hope to apply what I learn to address real world problems through various creative projects. I'm currently interested in learning more in various areas in technology, including AI and ML, full stack app development (especially backend design and frameworks), and webservers. 

I can be reached at jocelyn.wang2@duke.edu.
